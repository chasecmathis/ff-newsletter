4. Reviews the current week's matchups and starting lineups with commentary
5. Highlights bench performances and lineup decisions (who started the wrong players?)
6. Reviews trends and patterns from previous weeks (close games, blowouts, consistency)
7. Includes team-specific analysis and friendly trash talk
8. If playoff context: emphasize playoff implications, elimination scenarios, and championship hopes
9. If regular season: focus on early trends, overreactions, and building storylines
10. Builds excitement for what's at stake in upcoming weeks

Keep it entertaining with fantasy football humor and league-specific commentary!
