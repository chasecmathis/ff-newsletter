## The Weekly Whistle: Week 4 ‚Äì The Plot Thickens, The Panic Begins, and Mike Evans Is a Ghost?!

Greetings, fellow gridiron gurus and fantasy fanatics!

Welcome back to The Weekly Whistle, your trusted (and highly opinionated) source for all things *[League Name]* fantasy football. Week 4, 2025, is in the books, and if you thought the early season jitters were over, you clearly haven't been paying attention. We're past the "feeling each other out" phase and officially into the "OMG, what did I do to my team?!" existential crisis territory for some. Others? Well, they're probably already scouting Championship Week talent.

The regular season is a marathon, not a sprint, but some of you are already looking like you stopped for a hotdog at mile 2. Let's dive into the chaos, the triumphs, and the utterly baffling decisions of Week 4!

**The Sophisticated Computer's Opinion: Power Rankings ‚Äì Week 4**

### **Standings & Power Rankings: What Does It All MEAN?! (Probably Nothing, But Let's Overreact Anyway)**

Well, well, well, look who's sitting pretty atop the mountain, a majestic *Team Gang of Platipy*, boasting a league-leading 539.9 Points For. They're like that kid in grade school who always finished their homework before everyone else, just to show off. However, the Power Rankings computer, in its infinite, soulless wisdom, has them at a mere #3. Is it a slight? Or does the algorithm know something we don't? Maybe the Platypi are due for a regression to the mean, or perhaps their secret weapon is just *too* good.

Right behind them, clinging to the 3-1 life raft, are *Puka-chu* and the *Dillon Panthers*. Puka-chu is #2 in Power Rankings, while the Panthers are #4. Consistency, my friends, consistency is king (or queen, or whatever royalty you prefer).

Then we hit the Bermuda Triangle of mediocrity: a mind-boggling SIX teams are sitting at 2-2! From *Never Gonna Gibbs You Up* (#4 in PF, #5 in PR) down to *Poboy Pumbas* (#9 in standings, #11 in PR). This middle tier is more crowded than a Costco on a Saturday afternoon. Who will break free from the shackles of "meh" and start making a playoff push? Or will they all just cancel each other out in an endless loop of 8-6 records? Only time, and a whole lot of waiver wire moves, will tell. Special shoutout to *Never Gonna Gibbs You Up* for being 2-2 but rocking the second-highest PF in the league. Clearly, their losses have been... *spirited*.

And then there's the basement. *On Like McConkey Kong*, *The Queen's Lambit*, and *Goated* are all staring up from 1-3. It's not panic time yet, but let's just say the smoke detectors are starting to chirp. *Goated* has the ignominious honor of being last in both standings AND Power Rankings. Sometimes the numbers just tell it like it is. But hey, it's still early! A few big weeks and you could be right back in the thick of that chaotic 2-2 scrum. Or further into the abyss, either/or.

### **Week 4 Recap: The Good, The Bad, and The "Why Is He On My Bench?!"**

Let's break down the past week's action, where dreams were made, and roster managers wept into their coffee.

**Team Gang of Platipy (161.0) vs. hit it fergie üï∫ (154.0)**
*Talk about a barn burner!* This was the highest-scoring game of the week and a true slugfest. The *Platipy* crew showed exactly why they're #1 in PF, with **Ashton Jeanty (33.5 pts)** looking like a man possessed, backed up by **Patrick Mahomes (27.3 pts)** and **Amon-Ra St. Brown (26.0 pts)**. Even with DJ Moore and Jakobi Meyers having slightly down weeks, the core was too strong.
*hit it fergie üï∫* put up a valiant effort, largely thanks to the utterly transcendent **Puka Nacua (36.0 pts)**. Seriously, Puka is playing like he's trying to win *every* fantasy league by himself. **Marvin Harrison Jr. (18.6 pts)** and **Javonte Williams (19.0 pts)** contributed, but here's the rub: **RJ Harvey** was chilling on the bench with a tidy **19.8 points**. Sometimes, the bench just hurts more than a bad starter. A tough 7-point loss, Fergie!

**The Queen's Lambit (112.0) vs. Never Gonna Gibbs You Up (153.4)**
*Never Gonna Gibbs You Up* lived up to their name this week, cruising to a dominant 41.4-point victory. **Josh Jacobs (31.7 pts)** and **Bucky Irving (25.5 pts)** decided to have a running back party, and *Gibbs* was all too happy to host. A solid all-around performance from top to bottom.
For *The Queen's Lambit*, it was a case of "one step forward, two steps back." **Justin Fields (27.1 pts)** had a great day, but the **Packers D/ST (-5.0 pts)** decided to give up more points than they scored, which is generally frowned upon in fantasy football.

**Team Kirkland (114.1) vs. Finding Deebo (99.3)**
*The upset special!* *Team Kirkland*, fresh off a loss, took down the #1 Power Ranked *Finding Deebo*. **Omarion Hampton (27.5 pts)** and **Garrett Wilson (20.2 pts)** led the charge for *Kirkland*, proving that sometimes consistency wins, even if your QB (Geno Smith - 9.8 pts) and TE (Chig Okonkwo - 1.4 pts) don't show up to the party.
*Finding Deebo*, what happened? The computer had so much faith! **Justin Jefferson (22.6 pts)** did his part, but **Lamar Jackson (10.7 pts)**, **David Montgomery (1.2 pts)**, and **Calvin Ridley (5.0 pts)** all decided to take a bye week without telling their manager. When your #1 Power Ranked team barely scrapes triple digits, it's time for some soul-searching, Deebo.

**Dillon Panthers (110.7) vs. Puka-chu (93.1)**
The *Dillon Panthers* secured their 3rd win, quietly ascending the standings. **Drake London (25.0 pts)** and **Emeka Egbuka (20.1 pts)** were the standout performers, helping the Panthers overcome a quiet day from Malik Nabers and Justin Herbert.
*Puka-chu* might have Puka Nacua's name in their title, but he's not on their team (he's on Fergie's!). Instead, *Puka-chu* relied heavily on **Christian McCaffrey (26.1 pts)**, who continues to defy the laws of physics and aging. However, the rest of the team struggled. **Mike Evans (0.0 pts)** getting a goose egg is fantasy football pain we wouldn't wish on our worst enemies (okay, maybe some of you). When your starting WR literally scores zero points, it's hard to win.

**Goated (118.2) vs. Vegas Vikings (149.7)**
The *Vegas Vikings* put on a clinic this week, led by a monster performance from **George Pickens (33.4 pts)** and a surprisingly huge **17.0 points from Kicker Chase McLaughlin!** Seriously, the kicker outscored a bunch of starting RBs. **DK Metcalf (23.6 pts)** and **Matthew Stafford (27.4 pts)** also had big days, making this a comfortable victory.
*Goated* got some decent production from **Quinshon Judkins (21.5 pts)** and **Jalen Hurts (19.4 pts)**, but it wasn't enough against the Vikings' onslaught. And for the love of all that is holy, *Goated*, you had **Kenneth Gainwell (31.4 pts)** on your bench! That's another painful benching that could have changed the outcome. Get those goats out of the pen!

**Poboy Pumbas (115.0) vs. On Like McConkey Kong (101.6)**
The *Poboy Pumbas* snagged a much-needed win, thanks to **Bijan Robinson (28.1 pts)** finally unleashing his full potential. **Travis Etienne Jr. (19.5 pts)** and **Brock Bowers (9.6 pts)** chipped in, giving the Pumbas a reason to Hakuna Matata for another week.
For *On Like McConkey Kong*, it was another week of "what if." **Josh Allen (24.9 pts)** was solid, but **Ja'Marr Chase (7.3 pts)**, **Ladd McConkey (2.1 pts)**, and **Sam LaPorta (6.9 pts)** mostly disappeared. The biggest head-scratcher? **Bo Nix (25.7 pts)** was chilling on the bench, almost outscoring your entire WR/TE corps. McConkey Kong, you're 1-3. It's time to unleash the bench beasts!

### **Trends & Trajectories: What We've Learned (and How We'll Probably Forget It Next Week)**

**Nail-Biters vs. Blowouts:**
The early weeks were rife with heart-stopping, butt-clenching close games. Week 1 saw four games decided by less than 5 points, including a paltry 0.4 point victory for *Poboy Pumbas*! But as the season progresses, we're seeing some separation. Weeks 2 and 3 each had only one truly close game. Week 4 brought us the Platipy vs. Fergie shootout (7-point differential), but also a few absolute stomps: *Gibbs* over *Lambit* (41.4 pts) and *Vegas Vikings* over *Goated* (31.5 pts). It seems some teams are starting to find their groove, while others are still searching for their lucky charm.

**Consistency (and its Evil Twin, Inconsistency):**
*Team Gang of Platipy* is a scoring machine, consistently putting up big numbers. Their 539.9 PF leads the league by a landslide (second place is Gibbs at 511.5). This kind of consistent output is how you win championships.
Then there's *Finding Deebo*, the #1 Power Ranked team, who just lost to *Team Kirkland* despite having an average of 120.8 PF over the past three weeks. Their scoring has been a rollercoaster (128.3, 112.1, 143.5, 99.3). The computer thinks they're the best, but their weekly performance is giving us whiplash.
And let's not forget the "Bench Point Blues" this week, with *The Queen's Lambit*, *Goated*, *On Like McConkey Kong*, and *hit it fergie üï∫* all leaving significant points on the bench. Sometimes, foresight is 20/20, but hindsight is a real punch to the gut.

**Week 2 & 3 Stars ‚Äì Where Are They Now?**
*   **QB Lamar Jackson (Finding Deebo)** ‚Äì Week 2 star (26.3 pts), Week 4 dud (10.7 pts). Inconsistency strikes again!
*   **RB Jonathan Taylor (Vegas Vikings)** ‚Äì Week 2 (29.5 pts) and Week 3 (32.8 pts) star, a respectable 14.6 pts this week. Still solid, but not the supernova he was.
*   **WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (Team Gang of Platipy)** ‚Äì Week 2 (39.2 pts) was insane! Followed it up with 26.0 this week. Pure dominance.
*   **TE Tucker Kraft (Puka-chu)** ‚Äì Week 2 (24.4 pts) stud, 10.6 pts this week. Still a good performance.
*   **WR Garrett Wilson (Team Kirkland)** ‚Äì Week 3 (24.4 pts) hero, 20.2 this week. Showing some real consistency for Kirkland.
*   **TE Hunter Henry (Team Gang of Platipy)** ‚Äì Week 3 (29.0 pts) monster, 11.9 pts this week. Still good, but the 29-point week was wild.

### **Looking Ahead: The Road to Glory (or the Waiver Wire)**

We're only four weeks in, but the regular season storylines are writing themselves. *Team Gang of Platipy* looks like the early juggernaut, but can they maintain their blistering pace? The 2-2 cluster is a complete free-for-all, with *Never Gonna Gibbs You Up* showing flashes of elite scoring, while *Finding Deebo* needs to figure out why the computer loves them more than their actual players do.

For *On Like McConkey Kong*, *The Queen's Lambit*, and *Goated*, the time to turn things around is NOW. One more loss, and those playoff hopes start looking like a mirage in the desert. It's time for bold trades, ruthless benchings, and maybe even a ritualistic burning of team jerseys (just kidding... mostly).

The waiver wire will be more critical than ever, injuries are piling up in the real NFL, and every single point matters. Will we see more bench-point heartbreak? Will another team rise from the ashes of 2-2 to challenge the top? Will Mike Evans score more than zero points next week? (Probably!)

Strap in, fantasy managers. Week 5 promises more drama, more triumphs, and undoubtedly, more reasons to scream at your TV. Good luck, and may your benches remain mercifully quiet!

Until next week,
Your Esteemed, Witty, and Always Correct (mostly) Fantasy Football Commissioner/Journalist.
